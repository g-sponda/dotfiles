# Cacaricos dotfiles

My collection of configuration files, the usage of those files is discouraged, use at your own risk.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run make install, this will create a symbolic link of the configuration files to your $HOME dir. It should not overwrite your already existing symlinks if any.
```
git clone git@github.com:cacarico/dotfiles.git
make install
```
